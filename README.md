   - Aggregated sentiment at movie and genre level.  

3. **Regression Model**  
   - Engineered features from ratings, sentiment scores, and genres.  
   - Built regression models to predict **box office collections**.  
   - Evaluated model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤ metrics.  

4. **Genre-wise Analysis**  
   - Compared sentiment patterns across genres.  
   - Identified genres with strongest correlation between sentiment & success.  

5. **Visualization with Power BI**  
   - Created interactive dashboards to explore:  
     - Movie sentiment vs success  
     - Genre sentiment distribution  
     - Predicted vs actual box office performance
